            Eric (he/him) is currently planning to be $5 million in debt due to college in five years. If forced to chose three things that he needed to live with, he chose his electronics: his phone, his laptop, and his tablet. He watches seasonal animes, listens to Tobu, and plays nearly every videogame known to man. When questioned to chose just one, he responded with Roblox. When Eric is not watching anime or playing videogames, he hops on Discord and chats with his friends.
